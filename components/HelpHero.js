                Breast cancer arises in the lining cells (epithelium) of the
                ducts (85%) or lobules (15%) in the glandular tissue of the
                breast. Initially, the cancerous growth is confined to the duct
                or lobule (“in situ”) where it generally causes no symptoms and
                has minimal potential for spread (metastasis), There are
                different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer
                depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.
